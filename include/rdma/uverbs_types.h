	 * The flow of the different actions is:

	 *		 is called and the object is inserted to the repository.
	 *		 Otherwise, alloc_abort is called and the object is
	 *		 destroyed.
	 * [lookup]:	 Starts with lookup_get which fetches and locks the
	 *		 object. After the handler finished using the object, it
	 *		 needs to call lookup_put to unlock it. The write flag
	 *		 indicates if the object is locked for exclusive access.
	 * [destroy]:	 Starts with lookup_get with write flag set. This locks
	 *		 the object for exclusive access. If the handler code
	 *		 completed successfully, destroy_commit is called and
	 *		 the ib_uobject is destroyed and freed. Otherwise,
	 *		 lookup_put should be called.
	 * [hot_unplug]: Used when the context is destroyed (process
	 *		 termination, reset flow).
